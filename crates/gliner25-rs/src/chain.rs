//! One pipeline, two ways of moving tensors through it.
//!
//! The boundary engine is a chain of ONNX fragments. Between any two of them
//! the intermediate tensor can either be copied back to host memory and rebuilt
//! for the next fragment, or left where the provider produced it and bound
//! straight into the next fragment's input.
//!
//! Both are the *same* pipeline: same fragments, same order, same maths. Only
//! the transport differs. So rather than two engines, there is one chain and a
//! [`Chain`] that knows how to run a single step either way — which is what
//! keeps the two paths from drifting apart, the way they did when they lived in
//! separate crates.
//!
//! ```text
//!   Standard      encoder ──▶ host ──▶ routed_gather ──▶ host ──▶ head ─▶ …
//!   IoBinding     encoder ─────────────▶ routed_gather ─────────▶ head ─▶ …
//!                         (device memory throughout)
//! ```
//!
//! On CPU the round trip costs nothing — "host memory" is where the tensor
//! already is. On a discrete GPU it is PCIe traffic per fragment per call,
//! which is what `IoBinding` exists to avoid.
